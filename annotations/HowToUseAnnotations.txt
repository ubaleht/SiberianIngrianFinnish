HOW TO USE ANNOTATIONS

1. Install ELAN: https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan/download
We use ELAN version 6.0

2. Copy *.eaf files to your local directory. 

3. Copy audio files (*.wav) to your local directory from the reference in section: "Speech data of Siberian Ingrian Finnish" on the main page of this repository.
Audio file names must match *.eaf file names. (for example, copy the AAK-47-001.WAV file to the directory with the AAK-47_001.eaf file).

4. Run the any *.eaf file in the Elan program.
